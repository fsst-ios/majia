## Evidence limits

- Formatting, analyzer, and automated tests do not prove simulator or physical-device behavior.
- An Android debug APK is not a Play release artifact; Gradle may create or use a local debug keystore for that explicitly requested build.
- An unsigned iOS archive does not prove signing, installation, upload, TestFlight, or App Review.
- This script never performs production signing, changes production certificates/accounts, uploads, or submits; an explicitly requested Android debug build may create or use a local debug keystore.
